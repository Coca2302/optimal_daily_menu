# Optimal Daily Menu

## Project Overview
The **Optimal Daily Menu** project aims to create a balanced and cost-effective daily meal plan that meets nutritional requirements while minimizing expenses. This project uses linear programming with the Gurobi optimization library to select a set of foods that satisfy predefined nutritional constraints, weight limits, and a fixed number of dishes per day.

## Problem Definition
The goal is to design a daily menu for a student seeking a healthy diet within their financial constraints. The menu must:
- Meet minimum and maximum nutritional requirements for various nutrients (e.g., vitamins, minerals, macronutrients).
- Limit the total weight of food consumed to 2000 grams per day.
- Include exactly 12 distinct dishes for variety.
- Minimize the total cost of the selected foods.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Gurobi Optimizer (`gurobipy`)
- Pandas (`pandas`)
- NumPy (`numpy`)
- Seaborn (`seaborn`) for data visualization
- CSV module (`csv`)

## Installation
1. Install Python 3.x if not already installed.
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install gurobipy pandas numpy seaborn
Install Gurobi Optimizer and obtain a valid license from Gurobi's website.
Ensure the input files (price.csv and food.csv) are available in the project directory.
Project Structure
main.py: Main script containing the linear programming model and data preprocessing.
price.csv: Contains food items and their prices.
food.csv: Contains nutritional information for various foods.
matched_data.csv: Output file generated by combining price.csv and food.csv.
Nhom02_NguyenHoangViet.pdf: Project documentation with problem description, model, and results.
Usage
Place the price.csv and food.csv files in the same directory as main.py.
Run the script:
bash




python main.py
The script will:
Read and merge nutritional and price data.
Filter out unwanted food categories (e.g., fast food, snacks).
Formulate and solve the linear programming problem using Gurobi.
Output a DataFrame of selected foods with their descriptions, weights, prices, and quantities.
Model Details
Variables
x[i]: Binary variable indicating whether food item i is selected (1) or not (0).
q[i]: Integer variable representing the quantity of food item i (1 or 2 portions).
Objective
Minimize the total cost:
[
\sum_{i=1}^n p_i \cdot x_i \cdot q_i
]
where p_i is the price of food item i.

Constraints
Nutritional Constraints: For each nutrient j, the total intake must be within the lower bound (lb_nutrition[j]) and upper bound (ub_nutrition[j]): [ lb_nutrition[j] \leq \sum_{i=1}^n nutrition[i][j] \cdot x_i \cdot q_i \leq ub_nutrition[j] ]
Weight Constraint: Total weight of selected foods must not exceed 2000 grams: [ \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \cdot q_i \cdot w_i \leq 2000 ]
Dish Count: Exactly 12 foods must be selected: [ \sum_{i=1}^n x_i = 12 ]
Data Preprocessing
Excludes foods with descriptions containing "RAW", "GROUND", "SPICES", "FRSH", or "FAST FOOD".
Excludes categories like fast food, candies, snacks, and infant formulas.
Matches food items with their prices and saves the combined data to matched_data.csv.
Results
Upon successful optimization, the script outputs a table of selected foods, including:

Description: Name of the food item.
Weight: Weight of one portion (grams).
Price: Cost per portion.
Quantity: Number of portions (1 or 2).
If no optimal solution is found, an error message is displayed.
